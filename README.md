Bridge from Visual Studio to LINQPad
==============================================

What's LINQBridge?
-----------------

LINQBridge is a Visual Studio Extension for Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012.
It is a bridge between a Visual Studio debugging session and `LINQPad` (http://www.linqpad.net)
When enabled on a selection of VB/C# projects, creates a Custom Debugger Visualizer 
mapping to it all the complex types and making the magnifier glass then 
available for all of them.
